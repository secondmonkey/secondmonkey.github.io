<h3>What is product management, anyway?</h3>

<p>A product manager is - in a deep sense - <strong>responsible</strong> for the success of his or her product. A bit more concretely, I like to think of product managers as being charged with ensuring that their organization produces:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the right product...</li>
    <li>for your users / customers...</li>
    <li>at the right time...</li>
  </ul>

<p>For a more detailed answer, I highly recommend Marty Cagan's 2005 essay <a href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/productmanager.pdf">"Behind Every Great Product: The Role of the Product Manager"</a>.</p>

<h3>My Services</h3>

<p>Here's a (non-exhaustive) account of what I typically do as a product manager:</p> 

<h4>Strategy</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Competitive analysis.</li>
  <li>Decision framework development (how do you decide what software to build?)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Planning</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Breaking projects into manageable chunks.</li>
  <li>(In collaboration with engineering teams) forecasting resource needs and project durations.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Specification</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Detailing requirements with exacting clarity (I believe strongly in "user stories").</li>
  <li>Visually specifying interactions, interfaces, and processes.</li>
  <li>Building interactive prototypes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Project management</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Managing iterative development and test processes.</li>
  <li>Tracking progress towards milestones.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Measurement</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Selecting and tracking meaningful success metrics.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Team building</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Help to find and hire great product managers.</li>
  <li>Coaching and mentoring staff product managers.</li>
</ul>

<p>I love doing this job. But I also love helping organizations develop their <strong>own</strong> expertise in product product management, so I approach all of this with an eye towards helping establish product management as a discipline, with repeatable processes, templates, examples, etc.</p>
