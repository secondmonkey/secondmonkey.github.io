<h3>Product Management</h3>

<p>What is a product manager, anyway? My view: in a deep sense, he or she is <strong>responsible</strong> for the success of a product.</p> 

<p>A bit more concretely, as a product manager, one must make sure to build:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the right product...</li>
    <li>for your users / customers...</li>
    <li>at the right time...</li>
  </ul>

<p>For a more detailed answer, I highly recommend Marty Cagan's 2005 essay <a href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/productmanager.pdf">"Behind Every Great Product: The Role of the Product Manager"</a>. It's spot-on, in my opinion.</p>

<h3>My Services</h3>

<p>Here's a (non-exhaustive) account of what I do as a product manager:</p> 

<h4>Strategy</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Decision framework development (how do you decide what software to build?)</li>
  <li>Competitive and market analysis, model-building.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Planning</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Breaking projects into manageable, actionable pieces.</li>
  <li>(In collaboration with engineering teams) estimating project timelines.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Specification</h4> 
<ul>
  <li>Detailing requirements with exacting clarity (I believe strongly in "user stories").</li>
  <li>Visually specifying interactions, interfaces, and processes.</li>
  <li>Building interactive prototypes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Project management</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Managing iterative development and test processes.</li>

<p>I love doing this job. I also love helping organizations develop their <strong>own</strong> expertise in product management, so I endeavor always to establish repeatable processes, via templates, examples, training, etc. My goal is to help you build great products over the long run.</p>
