A response (heavily influenced by David Goldhill's indispensable [Catastrophic Care](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307961540/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307961540&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=secondmonkeyc-20)) to the five points in the well-meaning: [A Plan to Fix Cancer Care](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/a-plan-to-fix-cancer-care/). 

> the payment system needs to move away from fee-for-service toward a system of bundled payments, in which doctors are paid one fee for all the treatments involved

Certainly it does. But instead of replacing one one-size-fits all payment mechanism with a different (probably better, but who knows?) one-size-fits-all payment mechanism, why not free providers to experiment with 1000 different ways of charging for their services, and let patients reward the ones who come up with the best, cheapest, lowest-administrative-cost ways?

> Insurers have to give physicians information about where they are spending money," the authors write, adding that doctors "don't have a clear sense" of billing and payments.

Insurers already have an interest* in reducing costs, so if they're not already doing everything in their power to give physicians this information, why should we think that calling on them to do so more will help anything? The relationship between doctors and insurers is too adversarial for this to ever work. Only by empowering patients to demand this information can we impose this kind of discipline. 

\* For some surprising insight into the ways in which this is not actually true (making the proposal even more naive) read Goldhill.

> Any change in payment methods must be accompanied by rigorous quality monitoring to ensure that there is neither under- nor overutilization of care.

Great! Agreed, regulatory agencies should enforce some level of quality reporting. But what central authority can we rely on to be the exclusive enforcer of this? The only people who can effectively enforce the demand for quality are patients, by choosing which providers to frequent and which to punish, driving them out of business.

> We need more 'high touch' oncology practices. In these practices, nurses manage common symptoms before they escalate to the point that they require visits to the emergency room, and doctors talk with patients about palliative-care services and end-of-life preferences early on — not in the weeks before death.

It's a nice idea, but two objections: 1) how do we make that happen? We can build a new regulation to encourage it into CMS reimbursement or impose one on the insurers, and that regulation might kinda "work" in a static sense. But it will surely have unintended consequences, will be out-of-date in a year. And 2) in any case this is just one idea. It may be a good one, but we need 1000 more, and we need patients to vote on which ones they like.

> We need better incentives for research," the authors write. "Many expensive tests and treatments are introduced without evidence that they improve survival or reduce side effects, and with poor information about which patients should receive them," they continue, referring to robotic surgery, high-tech imaging, radiation therapies, and other matters.

In other industries, when an expensive product that's not better in any way than the products that are already being sold is introduced, what happens to that product? We (300 million consumers) decide not to buy it, and it fails. In medicine, FDA approval leads inexorably to massive subsidy. As a political entity, CMS will always be subject to political pressure from pharmaceutical companies and device manufacturers and a dozen other corrupting influences. If we're lucky, our political process may muddle together enough resistance to those forces enough to impose some discipline. But I doubt it.
