title: “Carless in the bay”
---

I've had a driver's license for 16 years, but I've never owned a car. When my
wife and I moved to the Bay Area in 2014, we decided to keep it that way. 

I naively thought it was like New York out here. It isn't, quite. But we've found that it can be done, and that it's far-and-away the financially better choice.

A few ground rules and caveats: we chose to live in Downtown Oakland, a 15 minute walk from three different BART stations. We also made a point of not hesitating to rent a car whenever we needed one...and to use Uber, Lyft, bikeshare, etc. to the fullest extent possible. 

Here's a screenshot of my phone:
