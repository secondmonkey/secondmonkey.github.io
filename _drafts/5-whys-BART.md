My BART suggestion

BART has some big problems. The last two days have been terrible. It's going to take a lot of time and money to make this system better. There are good people working hard on that. I'd like to propose one simple step that might help inform efforts to improve, and also improve public relations. Take a page from Toyota's book, and do a public "5 Why's" when things go wrong.
