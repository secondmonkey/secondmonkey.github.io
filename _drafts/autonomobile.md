Take a mental stroll around your nearest city. Don’t look at the buildings, or the trees. Look instead at the negative space, the parts you would normally ignore. What do you notice? 

Unless you’re in Midtown Manhattan, you will probably see that from the perspective of the pedestrian, the _majority_ of the land is devoted to infrastructure that serves the purposes of people in cars. 

Roads, of course. But even more importantly, parking. Surface lots, structured multi-level lots. The edges of all the roads and streets. Driveways. Garages. The first 4 floors of most high-rise apartment buildings. Here’s a map of Downtown Oakland, where I live, highlighting the parking: 

[map]. 

What if we didn’t need it? Like, literally, none of it? What would our cities look like? How would they change? I’m going to make two arguments, here. One: we’re only a few years away from an urban landscape transformed utterly for the better. And two, that it’s all because of autonomous vehicles. Lewis Mumford was right: “The right to…is the death of the city.” The automobile lobotomized our cities. The autonomobile will open an opportunity to repair them. But it’s one that we have to seize, and it will require equal parts imagination, foresight, and political will to do so. 

# The Nightmare Scenario

Victor Dover and other prominent urbanists have pointed out that   autonomous cars are the right answer to the wrong question. []. In a sense, they are correct. There is a real danger that autonomous cars will make us all worse off: 

Let’s say, in 10 years, you can buy an autonomous car. It drives itself home from the dealer and parks in your driveway. “Mercedes Theta Class - at your service.” Maybe it’s even electric. You’re not contributing to asthma with your tailpipe emissions. 

These cars are amazing. They’re so convenient that in the course of the next 5 years, pretty much everyone in your mid-sized city of 1-2M people replaces their old car with a self-driving one. They’re fast, and they can drive safely, even close-together. Crashes become infrequent, and for a while, traffic moves more smoothly. Housing prices in the suburbs and exurbs start to rise, as people realize they can be productive during their commutes, and traffic has improved, so the commutes themselves are shorter. For a while. 

Soon, though, so many people are driving into jobs in the center from outside the city that even with the increased carrying capacity of the roads and highways, congestion returns. Traffic slows to a crawl. What might have been a 60 minute commute 10 years earlier, that for a while took only 30 minutes, is now creeping back up towards 90 on bad days. 

People start to demand that the roads be widened to ease the congestion. They can get work down in the car, but four hours a day? That’s just crazy. We spend billions to build new roads and highways, and widen the ones we already have. But the traffic never gets any better. 

# What went wrong?

If you’ve read _Book_ or _Book_ or _other Book_ this may be a familiar story to you. You’ll recognize it as the problem of “induced demand”. In America, as Jeff Speck has repeatedly pointed out, the _only real constraint_ on driving is traffic, so when you take some drivers off the road, you almost always have plenty more to take their place. It’s really all about price. We can think of the “price” of driving as the cost, in time and money, to get where we’re trying to go. And anything that lowers these costs will tend to lead to more of the thing being - miles traveled by car - being consumed. 

Autonomous cars, if we’re not careful, run the risk of causing a  _massive_ drop in the effective price of each mile driven, and a concomitant massive increase in the total number of miles driven. Because not only will they temporarily, effectively, “widen the roads”, they’ll also reduce the _time_ cost of driving long distances.

# Circles - virtuous and vicious

We can think of the carpocalpyse I just sketched as the limit case of a vicious circle: “cheaper” miles means more miles driven. More miles driven leads to the return of congestion. Which re-activates the never-ending cycle of more road-building and more congestion, until Greenland melts. (Because - remember - even if those cars are mainly electric, a lot of the electricity is going to be produced by burning fossil fuels for the next few decades). 

If we can just get the incentives right, though, there’s another world that’s within our reach. And I might be a delusional optimist, but I think we might be able to get there, by following the contour of a countervailing virtuous circle.

# Take 2

Let’s try this again. Let’s say, in 10 years, you’re not living in a single-family detached house in the suburbs. You’re living _in_ the city. Let’s say it’s a townhouse. You’re within walking distance of a grocery store and 10 great restaurants, a hardware store, some art galleries, some bars and nightclubs. You can bike to another 50, and biking has gotten more popular, since deaths and injuries have plummeted as human drivers have become scarce. They’re still allowed, but the insurance premiums are so high that fewer and fewer people do it. The new developments in your neighborhood all have ground-floor retail - restaurants, bars, etc. - because no one owns a vehicle anymore, so parking minimums have been eliminated and most parking lots have been replaced with housing. Housing is cheaper because there’s no need to build expensive parking lots, and because the opposition to new development has waned, as parking and traffic have improved. But you want to go get Thai food at a great place 6 miles away, and it’s raining. You summon an autonomous car, and it shows up on your block 3 minutes later. You hop into your Goober, and off you go. It take 10 minutes, and there’s no traffic, because road usage is dynamically priced now. And it only costs a dollar, including the road-usage surcharge.

# How do we get here? 

There are a few key things that need to happen to make this scenario a reality. 

1. The cars must be a shared resource, not a private one. _Study_ recently modeled this scenario, and found that a city like [city] could be served by only _n%_ of the total number of vehicles currently on the road, if those vehicles were shared. Because they’re in use more-or-less constantly, there’s no need to park them for long periods of time. This may be the most important contribution that Uber and Lyft and other such services are making - they’re normalizing the idea that “not my car” can get me there just as well as “my car.” Actually better, because I don’t have to worry about parking when I get there, and I can drink as much as I want. 

Side effects: 
* radically better average fuel economy. 
** Because vehicles are in use almost constantly, their calendar lifespan is shorter, which means they get upgraded frequently. The entire fleet takes advantage of technological advances in near-real time. 
** They also exist in a wide range of form factors - from single person vehicles like this [Toyota] for when there’s only one of you, all the way up to buses for heavily traveled routes, so the average amount of steel (or…soon enough, carbon fiber) being lugged around with each human is decreased. You just don’t see many single people driving around in vehicles that seat 10 people anymore. You could do it, but why pay $10 for a ride that  costs you only $1 in a smaller vehicle? 
** Because they never crash, over time safety standards are lightened, and vehicles become lighter and simpler. They don’t need air bags, or crumple zones, or carefully engineered. 

2. Price signals, clearly conveyed

In many urban areas, it is already cheaper to go carless than to own a car, and it’s an increasingly popular choice. But the price signals are really hard to see - a car is a major purchase, and once you have it, you mentally discount the cost of the vehicle itself, maintenance, depreciation, etc. in each incremental trip. The cost of the infrastructure - parking, roads, etc. - is also completely hidden.  

To start the virtuous circle, we’re going to have to make the prices clear. This issue is going to become urgent as fuel economy continues to rise and gas taxes cover a smaller and smaller proportion of the cost of the roads.

We should replace the gas tax with what we might call “smart tolls.” All roads become toll roads, with no physical infrastructure to install to make it happen. All it takes is software, because the locations and routes of all vehicles are knowable at all times.* Add a congestion-pricing scheme, and you can _solve traffic_ once and for all. You simply charge the whatever price is necessary to keep all roads just below their carrying capacity. Simple schemes like this already exist. [citation][citation]. They’re usually met with outrage at first. But they really work. And in a world where routing decisions are made my software, not by humans, the reality of the choice will become clear: take the fastest route and pay a bit more, or a slower route and pay a bit less. Set your preference and forget about it.**

Making mobility an on-demand, pay-as-you-go service will make the real price of travel abundantly clear. If you want to live 50 miles outside the city, you can no longer hide from the fact that those 50 miles cost you $20 _every day_.

3. Full autonomy

Yesterday, the California DMV unveiled a draft proposal for regulation of autonomous cars, that includes the requirement that there be a steering wheel and a licensed driver behind the wheel, ready to take control at any point. Now, I can understand the impulse behind this proposal. Even with [n million] miles driven by the Google car with the only incidents being the result of abysmal behavior by human drivers, it’s going to take some time for the technology to become both fully worthy of our trust, and to actually earn that trust.

But it’s still a terrible mistake. The only way to harness the benefits of an autonomous fleet - to achieve constant utilization, and the end of the terrible waste of urban land that is parking - is for the cars to drive themselves around. Keeping human drivers as the norm will also make the entire system less safe, the cars cars heavier, more complicated, and less fuel efficient. It’s already obvious that humans are terrible drivers. They have no place at the wheel of a deadly moving projectile. Not to mention, for the elderly and disabled, this policy would essentially destroy all of the substantial benefits that autonomous mobility promises. 

4. Forward-looking city planning

The case to eliminate minimum parking requirements completely, even now, has never been clearer. Donald Shoup has been saying the same thing for 40 years, and people are finally starting to listen to him [link]. But in a world of on-demand shared mobility, the argument will become irrefutable. The case for mandating parking will be reduced to nil, the value of parking will plummet, and the opportunity to develop fallow urban spaces into homes for people - perhaps, at the same time, making a real impact on the urban housing affordability crisis - will emerge. Opposition to new development will become less vociferous, as the argument that density causes parking shortages and congestion will evaporate. As cities get denser, they will become more walkable and bike-able, because “The best transportation policy is a good land use policy.” [link] And as humans stop driving themselves, biking and walking will become even _more_ appealing, because they will become several orders of magnitude _safer_. 

Because planning policy decisions have decades-long ramifications, we have to start planning for this future. Eliminating minimum parking requirements is a good first step. But I would argue we need to go further, and institute parking _maximums_. We can also make progress towards this world by directly addressing some of the issues that Uber-like services have raised. Even as they make parking irrelevant, _loading_ zones become critically important. If we’re going to make on-demand mobility appealing, there must be safe, convenient places to load and unload passengers and cargo on every block. All the rest of the streetscape that’s currently devoted to parking? As people stop parking, those can become wider sidewalks and dedicated bike lanes. 

# Which Way Is the Wind Blowing

Who knows? Uber is raising money at a valuation of []. I would wager that’s partly because investors are anticipating a world like the one I’m describing, and that Uber is in a prime position to be the dominant provider. Young people are eschewing cars in larger and larger numbers. Everyone wants to live in the city - so much so, that they’re pricing out the people who used to live there only because they had no choice. 

On the other hand, gas prices are at historic lows. There are entrenched political and economic forces that will fight these developments tooth-and-nail. And people love cars. They are both intensely personal possessions, and the objects of a century-long romantic dream of freedom. Even if that dream has twisted into a nightmare. 

But I’m crazy enough to be optimistic. I think this world is _so_ much better, that it’s going to be irresistible. And the first step in working towards this world - a world with 150,000 fewer annual deaths from traffic crashes, where people live 5 years longer because particulates and ozone from car exhaust are eliminated, where people walk and bike more and are thus healthier and happier, where urban housing becomes more affordable - is to envision it. 

Take that mental walk again, with all of this in mind. You might like what you see. 


* There’s a real privacy concern here, but to me it seems like a surmountable one. And the shared-ness of the service actually works to the advantage of privacy. Remember - Uber-like services _already know_ about every trip you take. If the service pays the tolls, there’s no need for the government to know the details. 
** The details of the pricing are debatable, but I would propose something like this: each segment of road has a base price per kilogram. Each vehicle pays that price times its weight for each road segment. Add surcharges based on emissions and on congestion, and you have everything you need to encourage long-term improvements in fuel economy by making lighter vehicles, decreases in climate- and health-hazardous emissions, and to once-and-for all end the deadweight scourge of traffic congestion. The revenue from this kind of system could fund both  the construction and maintenance of the roads themselves, and a new generation of public transportation.
