title: BART Should Ask "Why" Five Times  
---

Every time something goes wrong on BART - which is distressingly often - there's an explosion of outrage on Twitter. I'll confess to taking a certain perverse enjoyment in reading the complaints. (Gemeinsamschadenfreude?). Usually, the responses are bland and uninformative. But this week, BART spokesman [Taylor Huckaby][huckaby-twitter] offered a [dose of radical candor][wired-candor]. 

I love it. It's refreshing to see an obviously well-informed public official tell it like it is. The transparency breathes some life into the usual ritual of recrimination and defensiveness.

It also made me think I should publish a suggestion I've been noodling over for a while: 
 
# Take a page from Toyota's book, and publish a clear, calm, transparent answer to the ["5 Why's"][5-whys] after every incident.

I don't know a lot about railway engineering, so this is just a hypothetical example. But say there's a "problem on the track." As soon as possible after the incident occurs, BART should publish a short blog post with the following information: 

* Date and time: [Day],[Month],[Year],[Time]
* What happened? Trains were delayed for 20 minutes system-wide. 
* Why? There was a signal malfunction.
* Why did the signal malfunction? Because the signals in that section of track were damaged by salt water in 2014. 
* Why haven't they been fixed? Because the manufacturer of the parts needed to fix them has a two-year backlog. 
* Why haven't they been replaced? They are on the schedule to be replaced, but not until 2017.
* Why not sooner? Because the maintenance budget is not unlimited, so we have to prioritize, and there are other problems that are worse.

It would require a significant investment of authority to ask these questions and publish honest answers. A cultural change, really. But I think it would be a worthy investment, with five significant benefits: 

* Demonstrate that there are many BART employees - like Huckaby - who genuinely care about the system functioning well. Dispel the impression of indifference. 
* Mitigate the frustration of seemingly random malfunction. Understanding *why* makes disruption easier to bear.    
* Give BART a perfect response to the loudest complainers. Respond to every Tweet with a link to the relevant post. 
* Perhaps, occasionally, expose issues that actually _can_ be addressed or prevented without massive investment (although I suspect that most of the time the result will resemble my hypothetical). 
* Build support for making the substantial investments we must make over the next few decades if we want a decent public transportation system.
