So you’ve seen the video of mean beard safety goggles hockey stick guy bullying the new Atlas robot. Have you heard the one about Skynet? Our new robot overlords will not soon forget, [everyone has been slaughtered][wired-slaughtered], blast that guy with a laser beam, blah blah blah, whatever. 

It's a cute story, but let's talk about something else for a second. When I watch this, I imagine herds of versatile robots: 

* Shutting down the next Fukushima Daiichi safely before it melts down. 
* Building and servicing a continent-sized solar photovoltaic array in the Sahara. 
* Rescuing tens of thousands of people from the rubble of the next big earthquake. 
* Helping millions of disabled, elderly, and frail people make it through their days.

It’s not that the doomsday narrative isn't interesting. It totally is. But the long-term existential risks have little to do with robotics and everything to do with applied ethics. (Which, incidentally, if you're interested in, you _must_ read [Superintelligence][superintelligence]). I also understand the need to laugh at this. We feel a twinge of empathy, because he's humanoid. We laugh because it's starting to get uncomfortably real. 

But I think it's more productive and interesting to focus less on the speculative long-term catastrophe, and more on the immense possibilities for medium-term good. 

So please, enough with the Skynet jokes. You’re missing the point.
