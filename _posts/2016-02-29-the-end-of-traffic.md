title: Autonomous Cars and the Future of Traffic
--- 

Growing up in LA, I remember being outraged by traffic, even as a kid. Staring out the window at the endless river of concrete and steel and glass. Wondering couldn't we just all go faster? 

Years later, my first economics class was a revelation, because I felt I finally understood. It had little to do with the way people drove, and everything to do with prices. That the roads themselves are a resource with a limited capacity. 

And then later, thanks to Jeff Speck ([Walkable City][walkable-city] - a must read), I encountered the idea of induced demand, which explains why endless road-widening projects never alleviate congestion. Because by doing so, we're boosting the _supply_ of space on the roads. But doing nothing...worse than nothing, actually...about the demand. 

Autonomous cars to the rescue, right? When they become commonplace, there should be far fewer crashes. Furthermore, they will be able to drive very fast, smoothly, and close together. 

It's a mirage. Because increasing the carrying capacity of our roads is in an important sense  _exactly the same_ as widening them. [And we've seen where that leads][LA-405]. Autonomy will increase road capacity - I would guess it may double or triple it. 

But will that be enough to compensate for the increase in travel that will come from the greater convenience of driving without actually...you know..._driving_. And the latent demand that will surface when the roads are temporarily clear? No way. There will be a tsunami of new traffic that will overwhelm the new capacity, and we'll be right back where we started.

Ask 100 economists what we should do about it, and they'll all tell you the same thing: set a price. We've tried it, and it works. The variably-priced toll section of I95 in Florida, and the London congestion charge, for example. But it's always a battle. Evidently, tolls are the only thing we hate more than traffic. 

Which is entirely understandable. We're very accustomed to the idea that the use of the roads is "free." Even if their construction and maintenance are anything but free. And even though we *do* pay in wasted time and fuel, in health consequences, and in damage to the climate.

So are we doomed? The cars will drive themselves...even more than we drive them, and the dream of the open road will remain just out of our grasp?

Maybe. But I'm not so sure - I think there's some reason for optimism. Last week I articulated one reason, which is that autonomous vehicles will structurally tilt towards sharing, and sharing makes the price of driving much more visible. But this is a weak effect at best. 

To head off disaster, we're going to have to do something more. We're going to have to put a price on use of the roads. All of them, all the time. 

Now, before you scoff "fat chance," let me say that I'm not naive about this. I know it's a radical notion, and I know it's not going to happen fast. But I think it's worth contemplating, because we're going to have to do _something_ to avoid a traffic death spiral. So it might as well be the _right_ thing. 

Here's what I propose. 

* Cars already "know" how far they drive -  and as they become increasingly connected to the internet, they can report back.  
* States...maybe even cities...could administer a program whereby, to keep your car or motorcycle registration current, you have to pay for the miles you travel.[^1]
* If you own a vehicle, it would periodically report back how far it's traveled, and you'd receive and pay a bill. If you rely on shared vehicles, the fee would be paid by the owner of the fleet and incorporated into the price you pay each ride.
* Compliance could be ensured by the existing mechanisms already in place to foil odometer tampering. 

So far, so good. There's actually a pretty good precedent for this kind of thing - it's called Metromile. A friend of mine has it. Here's what he sees when he opens the app on his phone:

How would the price be set? It _should_ internalize the full social cost of each mile driven, including the public health and climate effects of emissions, and the driver's fair-share of the cost of construction and maintenance. This would be a large number. Maybe we'll get there eventually. But we don't need to start there, and even a fraction of it would begin to tip the scales against the traffic explosion.

Where does the revenue go? It should be dedicated to mobility. Not solely to road projects, but also to public transit, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and the like - the alternatives that make it possible for people to choose *not* to drive (or be driven) if they choose not to. 

Let's review: we've got a road-pricing scheme where motor vehicles report their own miles and their owners pay a fee for each one. We're dedicating the revenue to mobility projects aimed at partly at improving* the roads themselves, but also to alternatives to driving. 

It's only a short hop further to redressing the worst of the negative externalities of driving: 

1. Prices should vary by vehicle. The more efficient the vehicle, the less the per-mile cost.** This would encourage people to purchase (and hire) the lightest vehicles that serve their purposes. Which in turn encouraging sharing, because you're not going to want to pay the SUV surcharge for your solo daily commute, but you're also not going to want to own all the different size permutations of vehicle that you might need. 
1. Prices should vary by time and place, with higher prices for the use of heavily-trafficked segments. A congestion charge, set at whatever price is necessary to prevent congestion. Intelligent routing systems with user-defined preferences could trade-off between time and cost. If you're in a hurry, you'll take the fastest route. If you have time to spare, you'll take the cheapest one.

What about the privacy implications? It's a legitimate question. It's worth noting that we already live in a world where private companies like Uber and Lyft know exactly who you are and where you go. But the concern is (properly) heightened when government agencies are in the loop. I think it's a surmountable problem. I suspect a system could be designed where congestion fees are paid, but without the locations of specific vehicles ever being revealed.***

By implementing a system like this, we can address three of our most vexing problems: traffic, climate change, and infrastructure funding. There's a real risk that autonomous driving will make all of them worse. But it doesn't have to. If we seize the opportunity and make wise policy decisions, we can turn the advent of this radical new technology into a catalyst  to finally _solve_ them. 

[^1] The long-standing Federal restriction on the states power to apply tolls to the interstates will need to be lifted.   
** "Improving the roads," in many cases, should actually mean narrowing them. Here, I'm arguing that we should price the use of the roads to discourage ever more driving and avoid a congestion nightmare. But we can do better - we can reclaim much of that space for bicycle paths, wider sidewalks, parks, trees, etc.
*** I would propose that prices vary as a function of three factors: weight, size, and emissions.
**** Perhaps there's a blockchain-based solution. If you think that sounds interesting and you're blockchain-savvy, send me a note - I'd love to chat.
