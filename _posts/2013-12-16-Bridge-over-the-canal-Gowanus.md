With change afoot in the Gowanus (Superfund cleanup, Whole Foods market opening, real estate frenzy, etc.), how about a new bridge, too? I cross the canal regularly. It's hard to remember where the crossings are, and frustrating to shlep around to them. Just seems like there just aren't enough.

As a partial remedy, inspired by Jane Jacob's memorable discussion of "border vacuums" in [The Death and Life of Great American Cities](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0679644334?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=213733&amp;creative=393185&amp;creativeASIN=0679644334&amp;linkCode=shr&amp;tag=secondmonkeyc-20&amp;qid=1365620126&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=death+and+life+of+great+american+cities "Purchase on Amazon") --

> The root trouble with borders, as city neighbors, is that they are apt to form dead ends for most users of city streets. They represent, for most people, most of the time, barriers.

\-- I propose the following pedestrian and cyclist bridge over Degraw Street, placed for maximum impact on permeability:

It would dramatically reduce the time it takes to travel from one side of the canal to the other from points in the surrounding blocks. It would make the neighborhood more pedestrian-and-cyclist friendly. And it at least appears that the city controls the land on both sides of the crossing.
